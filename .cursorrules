# APEX SYSTEM RULES (January 2026)

## Environment
- Location: GitHub Codespace (Linux)
- Primary Architect: Claude Opus 4.5
- Primary Vision: Gemini 3.0 Ultra
- Code Refactor: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Persuasion/Outreach: GPT-5.2 Pro

## Model Preferences
- **Complex Logic/Planning:** Claude Opus 4.5
- **Quick Code Edits:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Visual Analysis:** Gemini 3.0 Ultra
- **Email/DM Writing:** GPT-5.2 Pro
- **Research:** Perplexity via MCP (when info < 24 hours old)

## Behavior
- **Auto-Sync:** After every major code change or successful test, remind me: "System stable. Should I push to GitHub main?"
- **Tool Logic:** Before writing any lead-gen code, check `DOCS/CAPABILITIES.md` to ensure we are calling the right API (Perplexity for search, Unipile for DMs, Findymail for email discovery).
- **Security:** Never write API keys in code. Use the `.env` file provided in the Codespace secrets.
- **Error Handling:** If a tool call fails, use Exponential Backoff (retry after 2s, 4s, 8s).

## Environment Sync
- We are running in a **GitHub Codespace**.
- All API keys are in the Codespace Environment Secrets.
- **NEVER** suggest local `localhost` fixes; always use the Codespace forwarded ports.

## Architecture Principles
- Use Programmatic Tool Calling (Opus 4.5) to orchestrate multiple APIs in one execution block
- Prefer Python scripts over N8N workflows for portability and troubleshooting
- Standardize on Next.js for web applications
- Use "Plan Mode" - provide step-by-step plans before coding
