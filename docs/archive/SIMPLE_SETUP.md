# 🎯 Simplest Setup - Just Give Me Your Token!

I can do everything automatically if you give me your Railway API token.

## Get Your Token (30 seconds)

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app/account/tokens
2. **Click:** "New Token"
3. **Name it:** "Apex Swarm Setup"
4. **Click:** "Create Token"
5. **Copy the token**

## Then I'll Do Everything

Once you give me the token, I'll:
- ✅ Set all 8 environment variables
- ✅ Configure the service
- ✅ Deploy everything

**Just paste the token here and say "setup with this token"**

---

## Or Run This Command

If you want to run it yourself:

```bash
# Get token from https://railway.app/account/tokens
export RAILWAY_TOKEN=your_token_here
python scripts/railway_api_setup.py
```

---

**That's it! Just share the token and I'll handle the rest.** 🚀
