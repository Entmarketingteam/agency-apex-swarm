# 🔑 Get Railway API Token (For Automated Setup)

If you want me to set everything up automatically, I need a Railway API token.

## How to Get Your Railway Token

### Step 1: Get Token
1. Go to: **https://railway.app/account/tokens**
2. Click **"New Token"** button
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Apex Swarm Setup")
4. Click **"Create Token"**
5. **Copy the token immediately** (you can't see it again!)

### Step 2: Give Me the Token
Once you have the token, I can:
- ✅ Set all 8 environment variables automatically
- ✅ Configure the service
- ✅ Deploy everything

**Just paste the token here and I'll do the rest!**

## Alternative: I Can Use Railway API Directly

If you provide the token, I can use Railway's REST API to:
- Set all environment variables
- Configure service settings
- Trigger deployment

**The token gives me permission to manage your Railway project.**

## Security Note

The token allows full access to your Railway account. After setup, you can:
- Revoke it at: https://railway.app/account/tokens
- Or keep it for future automation

**Just share the token and I'll handle everything!** 🚀
